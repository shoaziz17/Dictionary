To build a dictionary app in React, you can follow the steps below:

1. Set up your React project:
   ✅ Begin by setting up a new React project using Create React App or any other preferred method.
   ✅ Open your project in your favorite code editor.

2. Define the project structure:
   ✅ Create a new folder called "components" to store all your React components.
   ✅ Inside the "components" folder, create a new component file called "DictionaryApp.js".

3. Design the layout:
   ✅ In the "DictionaryApp.js" file, start by importing React.
   ✅ Define a functional component called DictionaryApp.
   ✅ Within the component, create a form to take user input for word search.

4. Implement search functionality:
   ✅ Add state to the DictionaryApp component to manage user input and search results.
   ✅ In the form, add an input field where users can enter their search term.
   ✅ Implement an onChange handler to update the component's state as the user types.
   ✅ Add a submit button to trigger the search functionality.
   ✅ Implement a submit handler to fetch the dictionary data based on the user's search term.
   ✅ Update the state with the fetched data.

5. Display search results:
   - Create a separate component called "DictionaryResult" to display the search results.
   - Pass the search results from the DictionaryApp component to the DictionaryResult component as props.
   - Inside the DictionaryResult component, iterate over the search results and display them in a meaningful way.

6. Style the app:
   - Use CSS or a CSS-in-JS library (e.g., styled-components) to style your dictionary app.
   - Apply styles to the form, input field, buttons, and search results to make the app visually appealing.

7. Test and debug:
   - Test your dictionary app by entering search terms and verifying the results.
   - Debug any issues that may arise, such as incorrect search results or errors in the code.

8. Deploy the app (optional):
   - Once you're satisfied with your dictionary app, you can deploy it to a hosting platform, such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
